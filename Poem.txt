LSD Pt.1

[Love]
Love be only a preface to the role of a lover
Despite how much flawed that mortal may be
But best friend procures the tittle of life partner
Stranded with on a boat in the middle of the sea

[Friendship]
Nay I carry I’ll-will towards any party
Enough to waste time writing such useless taunts
I only ferry love and compassion to anybody
Bravely bountiful to bear my own faults

[Future]
The adventures hoped in future memories
Of which are only granted once in a lifetime
Are pointless experiences 
In the absence of your beloved by thy side

[Ghosts]
Before Death’s anxious visit
And my time as guardian of Venus has terminated
I wish to admire your influence towards my Id
If else celebration turns hollow once you step towards heaven

[Rules]
These are the precedents that aim 
To cultivate order between friendship and infatuation
As previously I’ve been blinded by a veil
That has deterred me from communal devotion

[Refrain]
Reinvention is the key to betterment
Regardless of past regrets 
Rind layers mark the beginning 
Roundabout the rise of Fall

[Epilogue]
The scene of a rainy night sets
The peaceful entrenches where we find ourselves
In a corner of the world where our awkwardness
Gets replaced with utmost Immaculate innocence
